    <h1>JOINT Section</h1>

    <p>The joint section is a combination of multiple chapters in the docs (Homing, Servo, Stepper, Timing, etc.)</p>

    <h2>Homing</h2>
    <p>Homing seems simple enough - just move each joint to a known location, and set LinuxCNCâ€™s internal variables
        accordingly. However, different machines have different requirements, and homing is actually quite complicated
    </p>
    <p>See the <a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.6/html/config/ini_homing.html#cha:homing-configuratio">doc on
            homing</a> for more info on homing </p>
    <h3>Homing Sequence</h3>
    <p>There are four possible homing sequences defined by the sign of SEARCH_VEL and LATCH_VEL, along with the
        associated configuration parameters as shown in the following table. Two basic conditions exist, SEARCH_VEL and
        LATCH_VEL are the same sign or they are opposite signs. For a more detailed description of what each
        configuration parameter does, see the following section.</p>

    <h2>TIMING</h2>
    <p>There are five timing parameters which control the output waveform. No step type uses all five, and only those
        which will be used are exported to HAL. The values of these parameters are in nano-seconds, so no recalculation
        is needed when changing thread periods. In the timing diagrams that follow, they are identfied by the following
        numbers:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>StepLen</li>
        <li>StepSpace</li>
        <li>DirHold</li>
        <li>DirSetup</li>
        <li>DirDelay</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For step type 0, timing parameters 1 thru 4 are used. The following timing diagram shows the output waveforms,
        and what each parameter adjusts.</p>

    <p>For step type 1, timing parameters 1, 2, and 5 are used. The following timing diagram shows the output waveforms,
        and what each parameter adjusts.
    </p>

    <p>For step types 2 and higher, the exact pattern of the outputs depends on the step type (see the HAL manual for a
        full listing). The outputs change from one state to another at a minimum interval of steplen. When a direction
        change occurs, the minimum time between the last step in one direction and the first in the other direction is
        the sum of steplen and dirdelay.</p>
